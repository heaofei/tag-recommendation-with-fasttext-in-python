# Tag Recommendation with FastText in Python

This tutorial walks you through how to build a learning model to recommend tags using FastText in Python. 

## About FastText

[FastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText) is a library built by Facebook Research for efficient learning of word representations and sentence classification. Weeks of playing around with this library has shown that it learns very fast indeed and provides an ideal sandbox to test your projects in. 

This tutorial will be focused on using the text classification capabilities of FastText to train a model that can predict categories based on the input data.

## Implementation of FastText in Python

Instead of using Facebook Research's CLI, this tutorial will be focused on the python interface for the library, [fasttext](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fasttext). Please note that this is not an official implementation of the FastText library. 

## Target Audience
This tutorial is aimed at anybody who has little to moderate experience with Python and would like to dive into the world of Natural Language Processing and Predictive Analytics.
